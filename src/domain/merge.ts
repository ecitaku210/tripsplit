/**
 * Merging replicas.
 *
 * This is the load-bearing file. With no server, correctness of the whole app
 * reduces to: can two phones exchange files and end up agreeing?
 *
 * The structure is an LWW-Element-Set, a CRDT. Merge is:
 *   - COMMUTATIVE   merge(a, b) === merge(b, a)
 *   - ASSOCIATIVE   merge(merge(a, b), c) === merge(a, merge(b, c))
 *   - IDEMPOTENT    merge(a, a) === a
 *
 * Those three properties are what make the practical workflow safe: everyone
 * can send everyone their file, in any order, over and over, and nobody ends
 * up with a duplicated dinner or a resurrected deleted expense. The test
 * suite asserts all three against randomly generated ledgers.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE, and no algorithm can: if you and your friend both
 * type in the same dinner as two separate entries, those are two genuinely
 * different records with different ids, and the merge keeps both — correctly,
 * because it cannot know they are the same meal. `findProbableDuplicates`
 * flags them for a human to decide.

/**
 * Total order over versions, so conflict resolution is identical everywhere.
 * 1. newer wall clock wins
 * 2. tie -> higher device id wins (arbitrary, but the SAME arbitrary choice
 *    on every phone, which is the only thing that matters)
 * 3. still tied -> compare the serialised record, so even a same-device,
 *    same-millisecond double edit resolves deterministically
