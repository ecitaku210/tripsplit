/**
 * Core data model.
 *
 * MONEY IS NEVER A FLOAT.
 * Every amount is an integer count of *minor units* (paise, cents, fils).
 * `12.35` is stored as `1235`. Floating point cannot represent 0.1 exactly,
 * so `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3`; on a shared ledger that drift turns into arguments
 * about who owes 1 paisa. Integers make the arithmetic exact.
 *
 * REPLICATION MODEL — LWW-Element-Set (a CRDT).
 * There is no server. Each phone holds a full replica and phones exchange
 * files. Every record therefore carries:
 *   - `id`         a UUID minted on the creating device, so two devices can
 *                  never mint the same id and merging is a set union
 *   - `updatedAt`  wall-clock ms of the last edit
 *   - `updatedBy`  the editing device's id, used ONLY to break `updatedAt`
 *                  ties so every device resolves a conflict identically
 *   - `deletedAt`  a tombstone; a deleted record is kept, not removed,
 *                  otherwise a merge with a stale replica would resurrect it
