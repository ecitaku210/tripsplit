/**
 * Turn a table of net balances into a short list of "A pays B ₹X".
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST "EVERYONE PAYS EVERYONE": with 6 people the naive pairwise
 * ledger is 15 transfers. Netting first collapses that to at most 5.
 *
 * THE ALGORITHM: greedy largest-debtor-to-largest-creditor. Repeatedly take
 * the person most in debt and the person most owed, and move the smaller of
 * the two amounts. Each step zeroes at least one person, so it terminates in
 * at most n-1 transfers.
 *
 * HONEST CAVEAT: this is not guaranteed to be the theoretical *minimum*
 * number of transfers — that problem (subset-sum in disguise) is NP-hard.
 * Greedy is optimal whenever no proper subgroup happens to net to zero, which
 * is essentially always with real trip amounts, and never worse than n-1.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: ties break on member id so every phone renders the same plan.
